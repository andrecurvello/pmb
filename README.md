PMB
===

Post Modern BASIC written in Java. The prime motivation is to write a language similar in many ways to a modern BASIC, but missing out on the not so nice features.

  * Use the CLI terminal as the window. Lanterna GLPL licenced.
  * Design for use on my raspberry pi.
  * Graphics via NEWT/JOGL and sound JOAL.
  * A fully extendable syntax.
  * Useful data structures.
  * Extension by Java Class loading.

Current Status
==============

Writing the type classes, and a simple test of the terminal. The type function dispatch is under consideration. This will perhaps change the type system a little, and the last implemtation details. Some of the implementation has not been done yet, to avoid later changes. I think I'm at the point of introducing the expression stack.
